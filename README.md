Each folder contains all the problems for a module in the Structy.net algorithms course. 

Each file will contain the problem, my solution(s) for the problem, and all the testcases my solution was tested on, including the expected output for each testcase. To see the output of any of the testcases for a problem, simply wrap one of the function calls at the bottom of the file in a print statement.

For many of the problems I coded multiple solutions. In those cases the extra solutions will have a number at the end of their function name so as not to be called by the testcases unintentionally. If you are trying out any extra solutions make sure every other function in the file, aside from helper functions, have a number in their name to not confuse the testcases. (Very important for the recursive functions.)
